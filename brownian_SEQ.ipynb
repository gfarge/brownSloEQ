    "Let's see how Brownian slow-earthquakes duration scales with their moment. As pointed out before, long-term slow-earthquakes are any given section of the simulated process. Their moment-duration characteristic distribution can be simply represented by the history of moment release in time. Let's plot it along with the moment-duration distribution of ideal and realistic detections for this run."

    "**Figure** *Moment-duration distribution of Brownian slow earthquakes*\n",
    "- The distribution of seismically detected events (dots for realistic detections, crosses for ideal detections) is shown along the moment release history of this run, representing the time dependency of moment release for long-term slow-earthquakes, as slow-slip events. The gray band represent a suggested scaling for slow-earthquakes $M_0 \\propto T$, based on observations of LFEs, VLFEs and slow-slip events of various sizes. Two major observations can be made:\n",
    "    * **(i)** on long term scales (above the damping time, $\\alpha^{-1}$), the stochastic process converges toward the $M_0 \\propto T$ scaling, as shown in a previous section\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **(ii)** on shorter time scales, for seismic events, the fact that a threshold is used to detect them introduces a bias in the moment-duration scaling, pushing it towards a $M_0 \\propto T$ scaling, whereas in reality, the modeled events would align along a $M_0 \\propto T^2$ scaling. As mentionned before, events are detected with a much lower duration and somewhat lower moment than the ideal moment. With real events, it would mean that some LFEs are detected as peakes of moment release within the undetectable moment release of a VLFE.\n",

    "### Let's try to wrap this up...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the model do with respect to observations?\n",
    "This stochastic model, with very few parameters and physical modelization, reproduces a few observations made on slow-earthquakes: \n",
    "* Proportionnality of the radiated seismic energy and seismic moment release\n",
    "* Proportionnality of seismic moment and duration of the long-term events\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are its limitations?\n",
    "On the short scale, it is tricky to evaluate if the conclusions it provides as to the moment-duration scaling are consistent with observations, first due to the bias that real-world detection is predicted to have by the model, and second due to the band limitation of most observations, which often focus on certain frequency bands to detect events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absence of any physical description of the process really becomes problematic when interpreting LFEs and VLFEs as the smaller features the model produces. In the model they are only small stochastic variations of a rupture patch radius. A more realistic description of how a fault patch behaves depending on the slip rate around it would need to be supplemented to either support or reject the smaller scale description.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As a conclusion, slow-earthquakes are fun\n",
    "In any case, this model allows to play with the different scales of slow-earthquakes and to conceive how we currently picture their relationship. The long-term slip process is what drives the seismic activity on the patch: events appear when slip accelerates enough to produce detectable seismic events. Low-frequency seismic events are thus a simple, discrete manifestation of an underlying aseismic slip process, which can only be measured geodetically on longer scales, and manifests as long, noisy seismic tremor. It is a great toy-model to practice the understanding of slow-earthquakes processes.\n",
